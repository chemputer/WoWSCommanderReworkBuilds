# Purpose

This is a repo that will allow for storage of ship/commander builds for the World of Warships Captain Skill Rework (0.10.0).
Initially, this will be based off of [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XfsIIbyORQAxgOE-ao_nVSP8_fpa1igg0t48pXZFIu0/edit) but changes will be made.
This is being done in Markdown as there are several ways to easily convert from Markdown to BBCODE, which is what the AOD forums use for formatting.
